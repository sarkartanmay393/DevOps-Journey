Linux is case-sensitive. We should remember it all the time.

Hi There, I am making a shortcut of a Path in Linux.

Man:
Grep used for pattern matching.
Cut used for filtering.
Awk used for intellegent filtering.
Sed used for Search and Replace in files.
Find used for searching files.
| Piping operator.
Locate used for search in database.
Pmap used for Memory map of process.
Tar used for Archive and Compression.

grep root /etc/passwd - Searches root in specific file.
grep -i root /etc/passwd - Does exact same, ignoring case sensitivity.
